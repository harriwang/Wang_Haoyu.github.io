## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics </a> M.A. student in communication science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Renmin University of China</a>, -->
I am currently an M.A. student in Communication Science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Renmin University of China</a>, working under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaofen_Ma" target="_blank">Dr. Xiaofen Ma</a>. I also serve as a research assistant at the Research Center for Health Communication and Sustainable Development, <a href="https://am.tongji.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> College of Arts & Media, Tongji University</a>. The center's research themes include tobacco control among emerging adults in Chinese culture and health promotion through multimodal texts targeting China's floating population. Additionally, I will study as a visiting student at the<a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank"> University of California, Davis</a>, from September to December this year.

**My research is motivated by the following crucial question: How can we promote a healthier and safer civil society?** My exploration in this domain operates on two levels.

**First, I focus on the role of digital technologies in promoting or hindering individual well-being.** In the past, my research has included evaluating the effectiveness of digital detox interventions in enhancing subjective well-being, elucidating the relationship between (dis)connectedness and individual Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), and analyzing the cognitive mechanisms underlying cyberchondria.

**Second, I investigate how to promote public engagement towards health, environment, and science**, and **how to build a sustainable balance and interactive relationship between the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems from a "One Health" perspective**. For instance, I have studied how to design persuasive messages to encourage public action on the issue of Microplastics (MPs), which is a significant concern in both climate change and human health.

My methodological toolkit encompasses a range of techniques, including web-based experiments, surveys, and meta-analysis. I am proficient in using software such as R, JASP, SPSS, and AMOS for data analysis.

I hope my research will contribute to the construction of a healthy and sustainable society, not only for individual members of the public but also for animals and the overall ecosystems.

Outside of academia, I enjoy photography, both digital and film, as well as photo shooting and documentary production. In this regard, I have won provincial awards in the Jiangsu Province Transportation Science Popularization Competition and have broadcast my documentary to the public during China Science Popularization Day.
