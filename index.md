## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics </a> M.A. student in communication science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Renmin University of China</a>, -->
I am currently an M.A. student in Communication Science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Renmin University of China</a>, working under the mentorship of Dr. Xiaofen Ma. Additionally, I serve as a research assistant at the <a href="https://am.tongji.edu.cn/EN/index.htm" target="_blank">Research Center for Health Communication and Sustainable Development</a> at Tongji University. The center's research themes include tobacco control among emerging adults in Chinese culture and health promotion through multimodal texts targeting China's floating population. 

**My research is motivated by the following crucial question:** How can we utilize digital technologies to facilitate a safer, healthier, fairer, and more fulfilling civic life? To answer this question, my existing research has focused on the **paradoxical nature of digital technologies** in both promoting and undermining public health. For example, social media can induce <a href="assets/FoMO.pdf" target="_blank"> social anxiety related to fear of missing out</a> and <a href="assets/cyberchondria.pdf" target="_blank"> health anxiety related to cyberchondria </a>, while also having the potential to promote <a href="assets/PEBs.pdf" target="_blank"> pro-environmental behaviors </a> in the context of microplastics and climate change. In my research, methods such as meta-analysis, structural equation modeling, and interviewing are used to explore the underlying socio-technical, psychological, and cognitive mechanisms behind individuals' digital media use for maintaining well-being or generating anxiety and fatigue. The ultimate goal of my research is to promote **a healthier civic life**. This extends beyond the physical and mental well-being of individuals to encompass broader issues of human health and destiny, such as microplastics and climate change.

Outside of academia, I enjoy photography, both digital and film, as well as photo shooting and documentary production. In this regard, I have won provincial awards in the <a href="http://jscts.org.cn/web/notice.php?content=true&newid=27" target="_blank"> Jiangsu Province Transportation Science Popularization Competition</a> and have broadcast my documentary to the public during China Science Popularization Day.
