## About Me

<!-- I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Statistics </a> M.A. student in communication science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> Renmin University of China</a>, -->
I am currently an M.A. student in Communication Science at <a href="https://en.ruc.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Renmin University of China</a>, working under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiaofen_Ma" target="_blank">Dr. Xiaofen Ma</a>. I also serve as a research assistant at Health Communication Research Center, <a href="https://am.tongji.edu.cn/" target="_blank"> College of Arts & Media, Tongji University</a>. The center's research themes include tobacco control among emerging adults in Chinese culture and health promotion through multimodal texts targeting China's floating population. Additionally, I am currently a visiting student at the <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">University of California, Davis</a>, where I am working as a research assistant at the <a href="https://medialabs.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Human Development and Media Lab</a> (led by Dr. Drew Cingel) from September to December this year.

**My research is motivated by the following crucial question: How can we promote a healthier and safer civil society?** My exploration in this domain operates on two levels.

**First, I focus on the role of digital technologies in promoting or hindering individual mental health.** In the past, my research has included exploring the relationship between (dis)connectedness and individual Fear of Missing Out (FoMO), and analyzing the cognitive mechanisms underlying cyberchondria.

**Second, I investigate how to promote public engagement towards health, environment, and science**, and **how to build a sustainable balance and interactive relationship between the health of humans, animals, and ecosystems from a One Health perspective**. For instance, I have studied how to design persuasive messages to encourage public action on the issue of microplastics (MPs), which is a significant concern in both climate change and human health. I hope my research will contribute to the construction of a healthy and sustainable society, not only for individual members of the public but also for animals and the overall ecosystems.

My methodological toolkit encompasses a range of techniques, including web-based experiments, surveys, and meta-analysis. I am proficient in using software such as R, JASP, SPSS, and AMOS for data analysis. In terms of analytical methods, I am well-versed in fundamental statistical techniques such as regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA), as well as advanced methods including structural equation modeling (SEM), latent profile analysis (LPA), actor-partner interdependence modeling (APIM), and meta-analysis. Currently, I have enrolled in Tsinghua University's six-month seminar on <a href="https://lcg.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1022/1803.htm "><i>Big Data and Causal Inference</i></a> at <a href="https://lcg.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm" target="_blank">Lab of Computational Social Science and State Governance</a> for strengthening my expertise in longitudinal data analysis and causal inference.

<!-- 
Outside of academia, I enjoy photography, both digital and film, as well as photo shooting and documentary production. In this regard, I have won provincial awards in the <a href="http://jscts.org.cn/web/notice.php?content=true&newid=27" target="_blank"> Jiangsu Province Transportation Science Popularization Competition</a> and have broadcast my documentary to the public during China Science Popularization Day.-->

## Research Interests
- **Media Psychology and Social Cognition:** Emerging digital technology and mental health (e.g., subjective well-being, FoMO); cognitive and affective mechanisms of persuasive message effects.
- **Health, Environment, Science Communication:** Public risk perception and engagement in health, environment and science (e.g., microplastics issue and climate change) from the perspective of <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/one-health" target="_blank"> "One Health"</a>.

## Awards
